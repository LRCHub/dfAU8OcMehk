[00:27.18] If you weren't told about any divinity
[00:34.38] If someone showed you our fallibilities
[00:38.60] If you weren't told about the trinity
[00:43.53] Would you still know what in the world created all this?
[01:11.53] 
[00:48.47] Wouldn't you like to figure out what's pulling the strings?
[01:17.97] 
[00:55.66] Did you know about varying degrees of free will?
[01:00.46] Compatible with senseless building blocks
[01:05.22] Did you know of adaptive or emergent properties?
[01:08.74] How a lump of grey is making you talk?
[01:27.74] 
[01:13.72] Now wouldn't you like to figure out what's making you howl?
[01:43.22] 
[01:38.57] Ill equipped to deal with infinities
[01:51.51] Never getting past the anthropic principles
[01:55.85] Ill equipped to deal with probabilities
[02:00.18] Can't help assigning intentions to all kinds of things
[02:27.18] 
[02:05.93] Wouldn't you like to figure out what's pulling your strings?
[02:35.93] 
[02:12.79] Now we could still talk about moral responsibility
[02:17.35] We could still talk about our common human goals
[02:21.56] What leads to happiness, what leads to suffering
[02:26.01] What leads to exuberance and flourishing of the soul
[02:52.01] 
[02:30.38] But it would help to figure out what's making us howl
